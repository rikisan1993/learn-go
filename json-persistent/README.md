# JSON persistent key-value store

created as a learning exercise, all credit goes to original code owner.
this project created based on [schollz](https://github.com/schollz) project on [jsonstore](https://github.com/schollz/jsonstore)

in time, you might the code in this project differ than the original code, as im trying to improve my undestanding in golang first before opening a pull request to the original repository.
